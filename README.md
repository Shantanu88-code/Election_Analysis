# Project Overview:
A Colorado Board of Elections member Seth has given you the following tasks to audit the election results of recent local congressional elections. 

1. Calculate total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the total percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner based on popular votes.

# Resources:
Data Source : election_results.csv
Software : Python 3.7.6., Visual studio code.

# Summary :

  2. Diana DeGette received 73.8% votes with 272,892 of total votes.
  3. Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% votes with 11,606 of total votes.

- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8% votes with a total of 272,892 votes.

# Challenge Overview :
Seth, a Colorado Board of Elections member requested to audit election results of the recent local congressional elections. So initially, we provided Seth and his team the following outcomes:
1. Calculate total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the total percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner based on popular votes.

Along with these outcomes, Seth and his team requested another audit for the largest county turnover i.e. which county contributed largest number of votes, also the total percentage of votes from each county.
Here are the additional auditing tasks:
1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout

# Challenge Summary:

- Total votes cast in congressional election

Total Votes: 369,711

- Voter turnout and Percentage of votes from each county.

Jefferson county had 10.5% of votes with voter turnout of 38,855.

Denver county had 82.8% of votes with voter turnout of 306,055.

Arapahoe county had 6.7% of votes with voter turnout of 24,801.

- Denver county had largest vote turnout.

- Each candidate's name, votes received percentage and total number votes received.

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% , 85,213 votes

Diana DeGette: 73.8% , 272,892 votes

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% , 11,606 votes

- The winner of the election with total votes and vote percentage.

The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received a total of 272,892 votes with a winning percentage of 73.8

# Election Audit Summary :

By using this script, one can also figure out how each candidate performed in each county. We have extracted each county's contribution in the election and 
each candidate's results. For example, Jefferson county casted 38,855 (10.5%) votes, we can figure out which candidate received maximum votes out of 38,855. 
Also, this script can be used on auditing state results. We will be working on larger data than what we had in this analysis. But using similar script and code, we can 
analyse larger datasets
